# income-classification

Objective: To predict whether an individual's income will be greater than $50K (A binary classification problem).

- Performed data preparation (handling missing/duplicate values, feature engineering) and EDA (descriptive statistics, simple visualization) to understand more about the dataset. 
- Built several classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier) and tuned their hyperparameters.
- Evaluated models above using F1 score (response variable was imbalanced) to determine best classification model.

### Background

This is a project for a Data Mining course at SF State University to learn about various ML models and their applications. The dataset used was the [1994 Census Income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult) dataset from the UCI repository. The data files are also attached here. 

About the data: Each unit of observation belongs to a particular individual (48,842 entries) and consists of categorical data (workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native country, and income) and numerical data (age, number of years of education, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week)

The variable income is the response variable.

More information about the dataset, preparation, EDA, Models, and Results is present in the [final report](https://github.com/i3house/Income-Prediction/blob/main/Income%20Classification%20-%20Project%20Report.pdf) and the [presentation](https://github.com/i3house/Income-Prediction/blob/main/Income%20Classification%20-%20Presentation.pdf)
